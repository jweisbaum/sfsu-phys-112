## Course Policies:
### Attendance and Participation
Attendance and participation during class are required. If you know in advance that you are unable to attend, please contact your instructor so that you can attend another lab section. If this is not possible, please watch the recorded introduction, and contact your instructor with any questions you have. Missed work for illness, family or personal emergencies will require appropriate documentation. 

### Write up of Experiments:
Experiments will be done in small groups; each student will write their own lab report, in their own words.  Labs have varying formats; typically, they will have several components:
* Lab Exploration: The is the main body of the lab and will take the bulk of your lab time. With you group, read each question, discuss, and then answer each question fully using a PDF editor. Take as much time as you need to answer each question until you understand your observations. While it may be possible to rush through the lab, you’ll miss much of the benefit of these labs, which are based in physics education research and designed to help you examine these phenomena carefully. Work with your partners: have one partner read the question aloud, discuss the question together and come to a consensus, then write your answers in the space provided using your own words. Take turns reading the questions, and self-monitor that all members of the group are contributing. Your grade for this section will be based primarily on effort and completeness.
* Problem of the Day – At the end of the lab, there will typically be one problem with several parts, based on the subjects you reviewed in the lab. Take your time, discuss your answers with your lab partners, and write out your answers in your own words. This section will be graded for correctness.
* Summary – After the lab, take 5-10 minutes thinking about what you have learned during the lab. The summary section first asks for you to recall one general physics principle you learned- this should be a generally applicable conclusion, rather than a specific result. (Example: “When we drop an object from any height, the energy in the system is converted from one form to another, but the total amount of energy is constant.”) Then, you will be asked to identify a specific question or procedure in the lab that demonstrates that principle. (Example: “In question 7 when we dropped the ball, the bar graphs in the simulation showed that potential energy decreased and kinetic energy increased, while the total amount of energy stayed the same.”) Finally, you will be asked to connect this physical principle to an experience you have had outside of physics class. (Example: “I was moving faster when I hit the floor when I fell off the top bunk bed compared to when I fell out of the bottom bunk bed, because I started with more potential energy and all of that potential energy was converted to kinetic energy.”) 
* Feedback - you will be asked to provide feedback on the lab, to help us further refine these labs for future classes.

### Assignment of Grades:
At the end of each session, students will upload their lab procedures document and submit the iLearn lab questions. Periodically, students will do brief reflective journaling on their experience in STEM.  Grades will be based on the following items:
* 80% Written lab reports and/or worksheets
* 20% Reflective journaling

Letter grades will be assigned according to the following table:

A | B | C | D | F
--|---|---|---|---
A: 92.00% -- 100.00 % | B+: 84.00% -- 87.99% | C+: 72.00% -- 75.99% | D+: 60.00% -- 63.99% | F: 0.00% -- 51.99%
A-: 88.00% -- 91.99% | B: 80.00% -- 83.99%  | C: 68.00% -- 71.99%  | D: 56.00% -- 59.99%  | N/A
N/A | B-: 76.00% -- 79.99% | C-: 64.00% -- 67.99% | D-: 52.00% -- 55.99% | N/A


### Expected Code of Conduct
